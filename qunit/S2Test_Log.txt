Testing Toast in coach registration
	testing fields with empty, filling out and removing and refilling out
	// problem with email field remaining red after entering valid email, 
		even after moving on and coming back to create coach account page
	// does not require a coach photo
	// can still add non-image files with no UI error
	// after removing team color and leaving field blank, field does not rest, 
		reselecting same image does not reset, changing images does/changing back
	// trying to go from 1 page to 3 page brings up toast "Please fill out required fields"
	// can back from page 2 to 1 with page 2 information not complete
7:33

	back to registration
		//display has shifted down, page is cut off and does not scroll
		//known error for user not submitting a profile pic

	testing create a team
		//displaying the team select, names are not lined up if images are different sizes
		//leaving Team logo blank generates toast "There was an error (111). Please try again."
		// adding a team does not refresh the page, 
			so new team does not show up until page refresh is manuely done by user
		// non primary team can not be selected
		// Create A New Team window stays up after new team is submitted, and can be resubmitted, changed and submitted,
			canceled after submition (stays submitted) and closed out of after submition (stays submitted)
First image fix (team select menu)
		// images now fill a square space limit
		// wide images have space at the bottom, tall images the bottom is cut off
		// long team names fill out more than their space (expanding up) and can shrink the team logo image,
			there action box also expands past its space and covers the team above them's box,	
		// long team names also get cut off at a certian point 
			(dont know if hight is centered on the correct box location or if it just cuts off at a certain length)
		// create a new team does not find a primary color
	text ellipses added
		//images are still to small but text is fixed
	images fixed
side problems
	// having multiple browser windows with the project running causes problems 
		(only one user per computer, possibly more problems)
	// on coach registration, if there is an error elsewhere in the submition, the team will be created multiple times 
		(each time submition is attempted)		
Login verification
	// currently does not work for pages /test /game-review

4/7/15 6:30
view/edit account
	// "passwords do not match" error appears on load of edit account
------->// change passwords does not work <------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
view/edit account testing failed moved back to inprogress
8:04 after fix
	// "passwords do not match" error still present
	// does nothing if new password is the same as current password
		worse than that if breaks the password
		(can not be reporduced keep an eye on this)
		// reproduced, when new password is submitted


Side problems
	// users remain logged in possible indefinently until they log out
	// user can be logged in on mulitple computers and can cause update issues

4/9/15 2:46
testing edit team & team select bar
	// interactions with team select and edit team button often take multiple clicks before anything happens
	// select team resets after page refresh but not page change
	// option for delete team is needed somewhere
	// if image is changed & modal is saved & closed bofore preview is loaded, 
		then the wrong image can load for the team initialy
	// team select bar is resizing when teams with longer names are selected
3:03 
	// multiple click problem might be resolved, can not reproduce at the present
	//
