testing player creation & roster update (on home page)
	// roster changed order, new additions are shown at the top, 
		then on later log ins moved to alphabetical rather than when added
	// no return to home button, need a way to refresh the page info without refresh button 
		(refresh button resets team, need to reload with different team)
	// homepage info can only show top team (can not change selected team)
	// does not load player for other teams when bypass if found to refresh home page info for new team
	// possibly parse did not save the new player yet
	// loaded again completely different order, seems to have little consistency

testing view schedule
	// hard added to db game data
	// orders games correctly according to date
	// proper coloring of games based on wins/loss currently 
		will color without regard for score just the win/loss/draw value (fine)
	// all information below the black game select bar is hard coded data and has nothing to do with selected games
	// logos are hard coded as Seattle Sounders logo vs FC Dallas logo
	// possibly add place holder image for opponent or ask for team number to search for team and use their image 
		(place holder for default if no team exists)
	// use team image for users team
9:05
	// player disappearing
11:10
testing top assist update
	// player game information updates
// welcome after log in toast can appear multiple times if login button is spammed when log in is slow
11:53
	// players are duplicated (fix in progress)
testing create a game
	// refresh required to update information
	// refreshing page can cause no team to be selected as current, causing no schedule, team info or roster to appear
	// game in the wrong order
12:22
	// top assists does not order when loading from data base (does it need to be ordered before saving to db or should it order after?)
	// same with top goals
	// game schedule no longer has the correct color for games (compleated/not won/lost/draw)
	//
